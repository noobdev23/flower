About our flowers


The most exquisite flowers and foliage each season.
At Lotus Flowers we embrace each season and reflect them in our sublime hand tied posys and arrangements. Our shop is constantly filled with the freshest and most exquisite blooms and foliages, hand picked at the markets each day and delivered from exotic faraway places such as Mauritius, Thailand, Singapore and Africa.

During the winter months the shop is filled with beautifully scented Freesias and Hyacinths, as well as unusual Parrot Tulips, lush Magnolia foliage, berries and bare branches.

As Spring approaches, so to does the much awaited Peony season, bringing with it the most romantic of blooms. Delicate feminine flowers including the divine Lily of the Valley and dreamy Gardenias are also on show in store during this time.

The warmer months represent an expolsion of colour in the forms of old fashioned favourites, David Austin Roses, Hydrangea, Tuberrose, and the ever constant Oriental Lily.

Each Lotus Flowers arrangement and bouquet is finished with premium hand embossed papers, satin ribbons and exotic Lotus leaves.

We welcome you to visit us and discover our flower secrets.
